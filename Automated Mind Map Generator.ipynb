        "The `find_optimal_clusters` function is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset using the elbow method. The function takes a single argument `inertia`, which is expected to be a list or array of inertia values corresponding to different numbers of clusters.\n",

The `np.argmax` function returns the index of the maximum value in the input array. The addition of 5 is a heuristic approach to account for potential noise in the data and ensure a more robust selection of the optimal number of clusters.\n",

        "The elbow method is a heuristic technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. It involves plotting the inertia values (or a similar metric) against the number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters is typically identified as the point where the curve starts to flatten out, forming an \"elbow\" shape. This point represents a trade-off between minimizing the inertia (or other metric) and keeping the number of clusters reasonably small.\n",

If the context-switch time is approximately 10 percent of the \\ntime quantum, then about 10 percent of the CPU time will be spent in \\ncontext switching. In practice, most modern systems have time quanta \\nranging from 10 to 100 milliseconds. The time required for a context switch \\nis typically less than 10 microseconds; thus, the context-switch time is a \\nsmall fraction of the time quantum.\\nOPERATING SYSTEMS\\nScheduling algorithms – Round Robin scheduling\\n\\nHow does context switching affect the performance of RR scheduling?\\nAssume, for example, that we have only one process of 10 time units. If the \\nquantum is 12 time units, the process finishes in less than 1 time quantum, \\nwith no overhead. If the quantum is 6 time units, however, the process \\nrequires 2 quanta, resulting in a context switch. If the time quantum is 1 \\ntime unit, then nine context switches will occur, slowing the execution of the \\nprocess accordingly (Figure next slide).\\nOPERATING SYSTEMS\\nContext switch \\n\\nSwitching the CPU to another process requires performing a state \\nsave of the current process and a state restore of a different \\nprocess. This task is known as a context switch. \\n\\nWhen a context switch occurs, the kernel saves the context of the \\nold process in its PCB and loads the saved context of the new \\nprocess scheduled to run. \\n\\nContext-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no \\nuseful work while switching. Its speed varies from machine to \\nmachine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers \\nthat must be copied, and the existence of special instructions (such \\nas a single instruction to load or store all registers). \\n\\nTypical speeds are a few milliseconds.\\nAlthough the time quantum should be large compared with the context \\nswitch time, it should not be too large. If the time quantum is too large, RR \\nscheduling degenerates to an FCFS policy. A rule of thumb is that 80 \\npercent of the CPU bursts should be shorter than the time quantum.\\nOPERATING SYSTEMS\\nScheduling algorithms – Round Robin scheduling\\n\\nTurnaround time also depends on the size of the time quantum. \\n\\nAs we can see from Figure (next slide), the average turnaround time of a \\nset of processes does not necessarily improve as the time-quantum size \\nincreases. In general, the average turnaround time can be improved if most \\nprocesses finish their next CPU burst in a single time quantum. \\n\\nFor example, given three processes of 10 time units each and a quantum of \\n1 time unit, the average turnaround time is 29. If the time quantum is 10, \\nhowever, the average turnaround time drops to 20. If context-switch time is \\nadded in, the average turnaround time increases even more for a smaller \\ntime quantum, since more context switches are required.\\n\\nCluster 2\\nOPERATING SYSTEMS\\nScheduling algorithms – Shortest Job First (SJF)\\n\\n➢At time = 9, process P1 will finish its execution.

        "Cluster 1: Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns, primarily attributed to human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These changes are causing rising temperatures, sea levels, and more frequent and severe weather events, posing significant risks to ecosystems, human health, and various sectors of the economy.\n",
        "Cluster 2: The primary cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. This releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, trapping heat in the atmosphere and disrupting the Earth's natural climate system.\n",
        "Cluster 3: Deforestation and land-use changes, such as converting forests to agricultural land or urban areas, also contribute to climate change. Trees and plants absorb and store carbon dioxide, so their removal reduces this natural carbon sink, leading to an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.\n",
        "Cluster 4: Agricultural practices, including livestock farming and the use of synthetic fertilizers, are another source of greenhouse gas emissions. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released from livestock digestion and manure management, while nitrous oxide is emitted from fertilizer application and soil cultivation.\n",
        "Cluster 5: The impacts of climate change are widespread and far-reaching. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and low-lying areas with increased flooding and erosion. Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to droughts or intense rainfall events, affecting water availability and agricultural productivity.\n",
        "Cluster 6: Climate change is also expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires. These events can cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt economic activities, and pose risks to human life and health.\n",
        "Cluster 7: The effects of climate change on ecosystems are profound, leading to shifts in habitats, species distribution, and biodiversity loss. Coral reefs, which are highly sensitive to ocean warming and acidification, are at risk of widespread degradation, impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities that depend on them.\n",
        "Cluster 8: Addressing climate change requires a multi-faceted approach that involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, and adapting to the impacts of climate change that are already occurring.\n",
        "Cluster 9: Mitigation strategies aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting clean energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and nuclear power, as well as implementing carbon capture and storage techniques. Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes can also significantly reduce emissions.\n",
        "Cluster 10: Adaptation measures focus on preparing for and responding to the impacts of climate change. These may include building resilient infrastructure, implementing early warning systems for extreme weather events, developing drought-resistant crops, and protecting coastal areas through natural or engineered solutions.\n",
        "Cluster 11: Land-use policies and sustainable forest management practices play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by preserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks. Reforestation efforts, sustainable agricultural practices, and the protection of peatlands and wetlands can help sequester carbon and reduce emissions from land-use changes.\n",
        "Cluster 12: International cooperation and policy frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aim to coordinate global efforts to address climate change. These agreements set targets for reducing emissions and provide mechanisms for financing and technology transfer to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts.\n",
        "Cluster 13: Climate change education and public awareness campaigns are essential for promoting understanding of the issue and encouraging individual and collective action. Engaging communities, businesses, and policymakers in climate change dialogue and decision-making processes can foster more effective and inclusive solutions.\n",
        "Cluster 14: Climate change also has implications for human rights and social justice, as its impacts disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized communities. Addressing these issues requires a human-centered approach that considers the needs and perspectives of those most affected, and ensures equitable access to resources and opportunities for adaptation.\n",
        "Cluster 15: Climate change is a complex and multidimensional challenge that requires sustained and coordinated efforts from governments, businesses, civil society organizations, and individuals. Tackling this issue necessitates a combination of scientific research, technological innovation, policy interventions, and changes in individual and societal behavior.\n",
